# Project Requirements

<H2>Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)</H2>

<H3>Objective</H3>

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

<H3>Specifications</H3>

<H5>Data Sources:</H5> Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

<H5>Data Quality:</H5> Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior analysis.

<H5>Integration:</H5> Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

<H5>Scope:</H5> Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

<H5>Documentation:</H5> Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
# BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

1. <H5>Bronze Layer:</H5> Stores raw data is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database,

2. <H5>Silver Layer:</H5> This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3. <H5>Gold Layer:</H5> Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
